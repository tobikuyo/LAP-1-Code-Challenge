# LAP 1 Code Challenge

## Installation & Usage

### Installation

-   Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Usage

-   Run `npm start` to launch server with `node`.
-   Run `npm run dev` to launch server with `nodemon`.

### Challenges

-   We were unable to create a page for search results and recipe details within the time frame, so we opted to log the results, when a user clicks on the respective button. We aim to fix that, as part of future developments.
